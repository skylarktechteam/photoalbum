# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
photos = Photo.create! 
([ {Photo id: 2}, { title: 'Chicago' } ])

# { name: 'Copenhagen' }, { description: 'Stuff about Portugese spelling' },
#	{ photographer: 'Leibowitz' }, { image_path: '#' }, ])


 #Photo.create ( Photo id: 2, title: 'Chicago'  )
